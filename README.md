# GitHub & Git Assignment 
## What I Learned from the Video 
### 1. What Git Is

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your files and code over time.

It lets you save “snapshots” (called commits) of your work so you can go back, compare, or revert at any time.

### 2. What GitHub Is

GitHub is a web platform where Git repositories are hosted online.

It enables collaboration, code sharing, and remote backups of your projects.

### 3. Why They’re Useful

Together, Git and GitHub help teams and individuals manage code, work together, and keep a history of their work. This is essential in software development.

### 4. Fundamental Git Concepts & Commands
The video walks through basic but important Git concepts such as:

Repositories (repo) – the project folder tracked by Git

Commits – saved changes

Branching – creating separate lines of development

Merging – combining changes from different branches

Forking – copying someone else’s project into your own account

Common commands like git init, git add, git commit, git push, and git pull are shown, explaining how to work with both local and remote repositories.

### 5. Collaboration with GitHub

How remote repositories on GitHub let multiple developers work together

Using pull requests and issues to review and discuss changes (typical GitHub workflows) — useful when contributing to open-source or team projects.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

Git helps track and manage changes in code.

GitHub helps host and collaborate online.

Together they are essential tools in modern software development.

The course is beginner-friendly, covering both basic theory and real example commands.
